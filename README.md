# paad-gene-expression-downstream
 
This task basically starts with the PAAD gene expression matrix obtained after the read pre-processing pipeline. The reads are further processed to understand the sample distribution/ clusters that are possible within them, which can be used to derive some conclusions about the data behaviour. As a part of it, various plots in different dimensions are also produced separately to understand the relevant features helpful to model the data.
